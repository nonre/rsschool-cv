## About me
Several years ago I admitted to the programming school. I learned C language and wrote some projects on it. Afterwards I got interested in frontend development. I learned HTML/CSS, JS basics by my own and have some work experience. My goal is to get nessessary skills to get a job in leading IT-company. 

## Skills

* React 
* Git
* Figma, Photoshop
* C, Python (basics)

## Code Example
```
function bubbleSort(arr) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - 1; j++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1 - j; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                let j = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
                arr[i + 1] = j;
            }
        }
    }
